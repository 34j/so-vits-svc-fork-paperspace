Use of Makefile is recommended, as it is more convenient to use the terminal than the notebook.

```shell
> make help
continue                       Continue training
help                           Show this help and exit
install                        Install dependencies
preprocess                     Preprocess data
tensorboard                    Start tensorboard
```
